The	O

two	O

(	O

An	O
in	O

setup	O
,	O
where	O
macrophages	O

are	O
plated	O
on	O
a	O
petri	O

respond	O

a	O

Using	O
the	O
computational	O
model	O

with	O
a	O
common	O
set	O
of	O
rules	O

we	O
successfully	O
simulated	O
both	O

can	O
not	O
be	O
directly	O

between	O
these	O
two	O

because	O
the	O

Our	O

was	O
to	O
compare	O
the	O
simulaltion	O
results	O
to	O
the	O
in	O

The	O

provided	O
a	O
great	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
more	O

Once	O

we	O
used	O
the	O
model	O
